MusePlayer
===========

MusePlayer is a utility for recording, saving, and replaying EEG 
and accelerometer data from Muse EEG devices. It can save to and 
convert between the native Muse datatype (.muse), Matlab (HDF5), CSV, and OSC 
replay formats.

This repository contains the sources for muse-player. They can be
used to generate the muse-player binary included with the SDK.
